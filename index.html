        <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
          with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook 
          and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
        <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that 
          should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made 
          the universe bang to begin with.<br>A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic 
          evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, 
          causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
        <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look 
          uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning 
          would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, 
          but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
        <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a 
          double box around it.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had 
          seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically 
          as inflation, looked right.</p>

        <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a>the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with 
          telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the 
          Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time 
          — so-called <a>gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently 
          apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They 
          are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, 
          that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>
        <p>
          Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, 
          wondered whether it could ever be proved.
        </p>
        <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable 
          to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big 
          Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science 
          and speculation.</p>
        <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion 
          light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an 
          infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are 
          unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of 
          other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>
        <p><strong>‘As Big as It Gets’</strong></p>
        <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at 
          energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new 
          insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation 
          of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general 
          relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
        <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who 
          was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
        <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending 
          a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”</p>
        <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of 
          microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe 
          when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, 
          for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results 
          in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a 
          set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
