# NYT-clone

This is a project where I attempted to clone [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0). This project was written in plain HTML + CSS and has no routing. The project is also not responsive as that was not the goal.
